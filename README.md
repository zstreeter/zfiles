# My Setup

I finally have a dotfiles repo like a real chad ðŸ‘¨ 

The folder setup is so you can grab what you want using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

# Icons

After running the `getnf` program and selecting the Nerd Font you'd like, you have many icons to choose from. Say you want to add an icon for something, you can go [here](https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet) and type in the font you'd like. The click the "icon" button, this will copy to your system clipboard and then you can copy to your terminal. For example all the cool icons in waybar are done this way.

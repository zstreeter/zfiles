# Unreal Configuration

As I develop more in Unreal, figured I should incorporate my workflow into zfiles.

NOTE: zfiles is not responsible for building Unreal. You will have to go and build that or use a release candidate.

## Aliases

So far, I have basic aliases setup for quicker development. However, this aliases file should be manually sourced to use the functions defined there.
